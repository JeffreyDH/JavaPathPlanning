# CS310_Project1
Project1

## Running the program
From within the Project1 directory:\
*cd bin/* \
*java SearchMap **__inputfilePath__** **__outputfilePath__***\
Program produces different paths when running the JUnit tests.
So *ExpectedOutput.txt* is the solution for the JUnit Paths so they should not be used to verify whether SearchMap works correctly w/o the JUnit tests.
\
Paths found when the program is run normally are closer to the ones found in the project1.pdf file.
